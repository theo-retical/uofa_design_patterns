Homeworks and Assignments for the course Design Patterns @ Univeristy of Alberta via Coursera

## Week/Module 1
### Ungraded Assignment – Adapter Pattern
You are working in an office with an old coffee machine that dispenses two different coffee flavours. However, the new boss wants to add a new coffee machine with a touchscreen that can also connect to the old coffee machine. 

Complete the provided code to add an adapter so that the new touchscreen will  to work with the old coffee machine. 

Use the following UML class diagram for a guide:

### Ungraded Assessment – Composite Pattern
You have been asked to create a playlist application that will be used on Android devices (using the Java language). We will assume that each playlist can be composed of songs or other playlists, or a combination of both.

Your project manager has told you that the composite pattern is best used in this situation. The following UML class diagram that communicates the application’s objects and relationships using the composite pattern.

In this assignment you are required to complete the provided code. (Note: With the exception of the Playlist class, you do not need to actually implement the methods, just write filler comments (eg., // play song). With the Playlist class, write out the method to add songs to the playlist).

### Ungraded Assignment - Observer Pattern
Youtube allows users to follow their favorite Youtube stars so that they will be notified when the channel is live. This is commonly done using the observer pattern. 

Complete the provided code and use the following UML class diagram as a guide:

## Week/Module 3
### Ungraded Assignment - MVC Pattern
You have been asked by a local coffee shop to create a system that allows managers to see, edit and add employee information. You have decided to create them a web application. They have informed you that they may decide to grow and expand later on and would like the system to be flexible to expansion. In this case the MVC pattern should be used. 

Create a UML class diagram that displays the basic MVC pattern for this web application. The system should keep track of an employee’s name, ID number, job title and salary. The controller should be able to get the employee model’s properties (getter methods) and change the properties (setter methods). The view should only display employee info.
